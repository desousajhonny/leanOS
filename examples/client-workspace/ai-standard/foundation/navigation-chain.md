# Navigation Chain

LeanOS uses owner-first navigation:

`Root AGENT.md -> Department AGENT.md -> Area AGENT.md/README.md -> Role -> Skills -> Playbook -> Output`

Use the chain to choose the next owner, one level at a time.

1. Root chooses the owning department.
2. Department chooses a workflow or active area.
3. Area chooses the specialist role when it has `AGENT.md`; otherwise use its `README.md` as the local map.
4. Role points to the required skills and playbooks.
5. Skills and playbooks shape the work.
6. Output updates only the smallest relevant knowledge, decision or project file.

Do not skip levels because a later file looks relevant.
Do not load the whole workspace when a smaller route exists.
